Opensource codes for package dynarr
#### Just begin.. still in progressing 
#### Already finished total simulations (200 simulations, each with 1000 iterations) 
#### But I want to modify code to Rcpp to improve speed (e.g., https://goo.gl/AWT13e ). Still need time..
#### Maybe wait till my current work (another paper) finished... 2017/2/27

1. dynarr.R ## main program in R
2. model_dynarr_testing01.Rmd ## first, small, testing program, with results in docs/
3. cfg_dyna.txt ## short configuration in dynarr, still need some document to explain parameter used (paper under submitting..)
