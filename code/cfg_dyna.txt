MaxDeadPeak	80	##too big dead number at one time at simulation will crash all system. Not reseaonble for dead caused by herbivory
Appa_ctl	0.1	#when,r=3, I'll turn off Flunc_flag ## set NA let apparent competition not occur # set value as minimum occurred rate
Flunc_flag	1	#TRUE, with recruitment fluctuation, otherwise, synchronous recruitments
Min_interN	3	##at least N >= Min_interN, interaction will act, otherwise, ineraction on the sp is zero
Min_interSP	2	##at least specise >= Min_interSP, interaction will act, otherwise, ineraction will stop
CriticalLoss	0.5	##Critical Loss rate of species number to check (0.5 is Half Loss)
Nct	0.50	##negative density-dependent effect, random choose (0-Nct) so, make mean intensity not larger than 0.5*Nct
VarNDD_flag	1	##turn-off variety in density-denpendent deaths, fixed at Nct
rare_chance	0.59	##give rare species more possibility to have a recruit or occationality of death > 0.5, so that round>0.5 -> integer 1
B	1000	##numbers of iterations
